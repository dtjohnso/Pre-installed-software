# Congratulations on your new computer!

I hope you're enjoying your new computer. This page is to help you get acquainted with some of the standard applications that I have installed for you. You can use the links below to bring up the websites for these programs.

## Standard Install

These are the standard applications that I pre-install on all computers I build:

* Browsers
	* Firefox
	* Chrome
	* *Why both?* It's good to have a couple handy. Use whichever one you prefer, try the other if something doesn't seem to work.
* Office/Productivity
	* [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - If you did not purchase a Microsoft Office license, this is a capable, free, open-source office suite that should meet the needs of the average home user.
	* [Foxit Reader](https://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf-reader/) - This is my recommended PDF reader application. It's more secure and robust than Adobe Acrobat Reader, and can do everything that Adobe Reader can do.
* Media
	* [VLC](http://videolan.org/) - A fantastic media player app, especially handy for videos. It'll play almost any media you throw at it.
	* Spotify - Free music streaming.
* Utilities
	* [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) - I've never met anyone who could remember all their passwords. This is a great little free, secure password management tool that I've used for years. Make yourself a little password database, and create entries for all your passwords. You'll have to remember the password to your KeePass file, but after that, it takes care of the rest for you.
	* [7-Zip](http://www.7zip.org/) - A robust application for working with compressed files (such as \*.ZIP files)
	* [ImgBurn](http://www.imgburn.com/) - I use this all the time to burn CDs and DVDs. Works great, very reliable.
	* [Teamviewer](https://teamviewer.com/) - Handy for remotely accessing your computer or other computers. Also helpful if you need me to pop in and look at something on your computer (don't worry, I can't access your computer without you telling me the secure code and password on your screen.)
	* [MalwareBytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) - A great supplemental malware removal tool. If you think you've got a malware problem, run a scan in here.

## Personalized apps

While building your computer, I will install other software applications upon request. Some common requests include:

* Media
	* iTunes
	* [MediaMonkey](http://www.mediamonkey.com/) - Unless you need iTunes, I actually recommend that you try MediaMonkey. I prefer it to iTunes and use it myself. However, if you're already happy with iTunes I can install that for you instead.
	* [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/) - Useful if you want to record audio files.
* Communication
	* Skype
	* [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) - Email client. Free, open-source, lots of satisfied users.
* Cloud Storage
	* [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/)
	* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) (now named Google Backup and Sync)
* Other
	* [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/)
